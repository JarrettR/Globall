Globall
================


### What's this?

This is a persistence-of-vision-based 3D globe.

### What's that?

Persistence of vision is the phenomenon where something moving very fast appears to be an entire collection of objects. Generally involving light, it can fool our eyes into believing that we're seeing a single line of light when there's really only one, or a 2D image, when there's really only a single line of lights turning on and off quickly.

### Cool! How does that relate?

By arranging LEDs around a circle and spinning it very rapidly, an image can be created. The primary use-case of this repo is to create a globe (using green and blue LEDs), but it can easily be used for text or any other arbitrary image.

### Status

This is under sporadic development.
The firmware is compilable, and it can generate passable images.
The PCB works, but will eventually go through a redesign. More LEDs, smaller LEDs, and a bunch of the power supply features can be stripped out.
The mechanical design has always been intended to be a minimum viable product, and is very functional. A redesign to make it prettier will eventually happen.
The image converter in the tools page might be useful for other POV systems at this change, check it out.

### Contributing

Please don't, just yet! This is a relatively easy practice project, and I'd like to work through all the pitfalls myself. Suggestions welcome, however.


### Further Reading

When there is a minimal level of completion, something will be on my website, [here](https://jrainimo.com/build/).

Until then, I am writing regular build logs on the [Hackaday Projects](https://hackaday.io/project/27580) site. Be warned, unpolished content ahead.
